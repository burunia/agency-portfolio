              We understand how daunting outsourcing designs can be, whether for product photography, branding or design. What happens after you say yes? How do we make sure your vision is brought to life? That's where our streamlined design process comes in, built on clear, open communication and a collaborative system that keeps you informed every step of the way without overwhelming you.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 font-vidaloka">Step 1: Creating Your Dedicated Project Space</h2>
            <p className="font-roboto">
              Once we start working together, we'll set you up with your own Basecamp account. This is your space to upload briefs, view timelines, share your feedback and stay connected with your team throughout the project.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 font-vidaloka">Step 2: The Start of the Workflow</h2>
            <p className="font-roboto">
              Once a new product brief has been uploaded to your Basecamp, whether it be for product design, image stacks or product packaging, it instantly syncs to our internal team Trello system. There, your project is assigned to a suitable designer on our team and the work begins immediately.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 font-vidaloka">Step 3: Review, Clarify & Collaborate</h2>
            <p className="font-roboto">
              Before jumping in and starting the new project, we take the time to carefully read through your brief. If anything needs clarification or could benefit from a discussion, we'll reach out, either via Basecamp or a quick call. We believe that great designs start with clear communication, and we work closely with you to ensure we're aligned before moving forward.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 font-vidaloka">Step 4: Initial Concepts & Your Feedback</h2>
            <p className="font-roboto">
              Once we are confident we have all the necessary information and all teams are set up for success, our design team starts crafting your visuals and building concepts. Once ready, we'll send you the first round for review. You'll have the opportunity to provide feedback, request changes or confirm if we're on the right track. Your input is always highly regarded.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 font-vidaloka">Step 5: The Final Design & Delivery</h2>
            <p className="font-roboto">
              After any revisions and feedback we move into final production. Whether it be high-converting image stacks, product packaging or a fully designed product, we deliver everything in the formats you need, on time and ready to use.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 font-vidaloka">Why Clients Love This Process</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 font-roboto">
